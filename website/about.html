        <p id="about">
          Founded in 2022, Empowering the Nation provides classes in
          Johannesburg. In order to empower themselves and equip them with more
          marketable skills, hundreds of gardeners and domestic workers have
          participated in the six-week Short Skills Training Programs and the
          six-month Learnerships. Our primary focus is on providing high-quality
          training to domestic workers and gardeners. We offer two main
          programs: a six-month Learnership program and a six-week Short Skills
          Training Programme. Through these courses, we have successfully
          trained hundreds of individuals, helping them to develop marketable
          skills and achieve greater economic independence. At Empowering the
          Nation, we believe that education is the key to empowerment. Our goal
          is to create a positive impact on our community by equipping people
          with the tools they need to build a better future for themselves and
          their families.
